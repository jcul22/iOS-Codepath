### Notes
I had a hard time adjusting from the videos just because he was going so fast and xCode has changed a lot of things about the way xCode works and looks so it was a lot of experimenting or Googling to get it done.
As well as the fact that due to the fact that I'm using a VM so I wasn't able to use the posters because I am not an admin on the VM so I could not install it. Please keep this in consideration when scoring my assignment.
